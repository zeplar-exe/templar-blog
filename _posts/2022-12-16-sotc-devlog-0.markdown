I've always liked grand strategy games. For the most part, they require you to think about things. Your next move, your opponents' next moves, the state of your country (usually), etc. It just has so many moving parts that are fun to keep track of. Naturally, I'd want to build one, just a 'simple' grand strategy. That's where this idea comes from.

"States of the Country" is a grand strategy where you take the place of a country's leader, whether that be an elected president or a hereditary monarch. There is no world, just your singular country. War is simulated by how many soldiers you "send" to fight, and that is all. Your focus on on domestic matters with the economy, politics, and internal stability.

Similar to [Paradox's](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/) grand strategy games, there are numerous decisions, and events that can take place for your country. Ranging from minor social unrest to initiating coups. Alongside a mission tree to help guide the player and provide rewards. Otherwise, there will be an easily moddable system in place for creating countries, events, etc.

So, not too ambitious, and surely well-thought out, right? (it's not)
