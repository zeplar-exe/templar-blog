I've always liked grand strategy games. For the most part, they require you to think about things. Your next move, your opponents' next moves, the state of your country (usually), etc. It just has so many moving parts that are fun to keep track of. Naturally, I'd want to build one, just a 'simple' grand strategy. That's where this idea comes from.

"States of the Country" is a grand strategy where you take the place of a country's leader, whether that be an elected president or a hereditary monarch.
